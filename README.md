## _About Project_

**In this project, we have developed a bussines system for Yavuz Otomotiv. Company sells car spare parts, to control stock and to keep supplier and customer information in the
system. The database was made for the company’s employees to use it comfortably with MSSQL.**

- Goals

The aim of this business process is to provide a database service to the
company in the auto spare parts industry and to organize and simplify data such as
stock, spare parts, customer information and supplier information etc. This business
is created to provide parts sourcing, stock control and parts sales with minimum
time and labor.

- Planning and Mapping Process

Understanding our customer’s needs is our initial method for achieving our
aim. Then divide the tasks among team members and carry them out. Following that,
we keep our customers informed about our process, ask for their feedback, and give
direction to the project according to customer feedback. Continue in this manner
until the job is completed.

- Actions and Stakeholders

Yavuz Otomotiv gave us the information we needed regarding their business
process and requirements. They also gave us overviews and feedback to help us
progress. Entities were determined with project team members according to the
requirements of the company. We were drawn to an Entity Relationship Diagram(ER).
